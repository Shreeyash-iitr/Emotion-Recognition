# Emotion-Recognition
This is a deep learning project for facial emotion recognition in real time. I have used [fer2013](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data) dataset for classification.<p>
There are three major parts:</br>
  (1)Preprocessing</br>
  (2)Training CNN model</br>
  (3)Runtime execution</br>
